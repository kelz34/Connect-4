Connect 4!!!

Project Description
This is the classic game Connect 4, where two players go head-to-head strategizing how to connect for checkers in a row while making sure their opponent doesn't!
Here's how to play, grab one of your chosen colored checkers and drop it in any column of the vertical board. The board has 7 columns and 6 rows. Each player gets 21 checkers and a choice of color for their checker.
To win is simple, align 4 of your checkers in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally within the checker board and you win!
